## 1. Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/najim2004/task-sphere.git
    cd task-sphere
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the `.env` file and fill in the required values:
      ```env
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_strong_jwt_secret
      REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
      REDIS_PORT=6379
      REDIS_PASSWORD=
      ```

### Running the Application

-   **Development mode with watch:**
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```
-   **Production mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run start:prod
    ```

## 2. Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular architecture, leveraging the power of NestJS for separation of concerns and scalability.

-   **Core Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
-   **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) for object data modeling (ODM).
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication using [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/).
-   **Real-time Communication**: [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) for real-time features, particularly for the notification system.
-   **Caching**: In-memory and [Redis](https://redis.io/) caching via NestJS's `CacheModule` to improve performance.
-   **Background Jobs**: [Bull](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) with Redis for managing background jobs and queues.

### Key Modules

-   `/src/modules/auth`: Handles user login and JWT strategy.
-   `/src/modules/users`: Manages user creation and profiles.
-   `/src/modules/projects`: Manages projects and team members.
-   `/src/modules/tasks`: Manages tasks within projects.
-   `/src/modules/notifications`: A complete real-time notification system.

### Notification System Flow

1.  **Event Trigger**: An action in a service (e.g., `TasksService`) triggers a notification.
2.  **Service Call**: The service calls `NotificationsService` with recipient and payload data.
3.  **Persistence**: `NotificationsService` saves the notification to the MongoDB database.
4.  **Real-time Push**: The service then calls `NotificationsGateway`.
5.  **WebSocket Emission**: The gateway pushes the notification to the recipient's private room via Socket.IO, delivering it instantly to the client-side.

## 3. Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed with scalability in mind:

1.  **Stateless Application Layer**: The NestJS application is stateless. You can run multiple instances of the application behind a load balancer to handle increased traffic.

2.  **Database Scaling**: MongoDB can be scaled horizontally using **sharding** and made highly available using **replica sets**.

3.  **WebSocket Scaling**: To scale the real-time layer across multiple instances, the default Socket.IO server needs a Redis adapter. This allows different server instances to broadcast events to all clients, regardless of which instance a client is connected to. You can implement this using NestJS's platform-socket.io adapters.

4.  **Decoupled Job Queue**: By using Bull and Redis, background tasks (e.g., sending emails, processing data) are decoupled from the main application flow. The queue workers can be scaled independently as needed.
